# CampusCoins Campus Token Rewards System

## Overview

CampusCoins is a blockchain-based token reward system designed to encourage student 
participation in academic and extracurricular activities. By leveraging smart contracts on 
the Polygon blockchain, students can earn tokens for various achievements (such as scoring 
well in assessments or attending events) and redeem them at campus facilities like the 
canteen and bookstore. Additionally, a slashing mechanism deducts tokens for rule 
violations, ensuring discipline and fairness in the reward system.
